    /*
     Cucumber topics:
            1. Scenario: a test case
                Scenario Steps are written by 6 syntax of cucumber:
                        When, Given, Then, And, But, *
                        Ex:
                            When go to URL      ==> @When
                            and Click the button  ==>  @When
                            Then something displays  ==> @Then
                            * test completed        ==>  @Then

            2. parameterizing: 'data'   or  "data"

                    Ex:
                        When go to web
                        And Enter 'Apple'



            3. Pipe line: | used for to give data tables (Excample Tables)
                    we used them in Scenario OutLine and Scenario Templete

            4. Background: runs before each scenario with in the featurefile
                    it only applies to the specific feature files' scenarios

                @Before: applies to all feature files


            5. Scenario vs Scenario outline vs Scenario Templete
                    Scenario : a single Test Case
                    Scenario Outline: to test multiple data within a scenario, There has to examle tables
                            '< >' , "< >"

                    Scenario Templete: does the exact same thing with Scenario outline
                            (larger)

            6. runner class:
                    @RunWith: junit

                    @CucumberOptions: cucumber
                            feature: define the path of the feature files
                            glue: define the path of cucumber annotions
                                        (@when, @Then, @Given, @Before, @After)
                                any class that contains cucumber annotations, cannot be extended, that's why we use glue

                            tags: define which feature files or scenarios to run
                                    tags can be shared

                            dryrun:
                                false: it runs the step definitions, then runs the
                                feature files and if there is any unimplemented steps,
                                it will give us in the output

                                true: only runs feature files, then if there is
                                any unimplemented steps, it will give us in
                                the output


                            plugin: generate cucumber reports


            7. cucumber annotations:
                    @When : scenario steps
                    @Gievn: scenario steps
                    @Then: scenario steps

                    @Before: runs before each scenario' execution (entire feature files)
                    @After:  runs after each scenario' execution (entire feature)

                If any class contains any of those annotation The class cannot be extended
                    Ex: if we extend our hooks class or step definition class, it will give errors during runtime


     @BeforeGroup,
     @BeforeSuite
     @BeforeTest


     @Test(groupName ="groupname"  suitName = "Suitname",  name="testname")

      first we need to do grouping in XML file, then we can use @Beforegroup, @BeforeTest, @BeforeSuqit



    ignoreTest:
     @Test(enable = false)

     @Test() @Ignore
